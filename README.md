🌟 Excited to share the third project of my internship at Oasis Infobyte! 🚀

📝 Built a To-Do Web App using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Creating an app that organizes tasks and boosts productivity was an enriching challenge.

🖥️ Crafting an interactive and user-friendly interface taught me the power of merging design with functionality to create practical solutions.
